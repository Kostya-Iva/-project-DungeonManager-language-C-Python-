# -project-DungeonManager-language-C-Python-
Project made to simlplify any preparations needed to play the Dungeons&Dragons


Currently working on:
Dungeon Combat Guide (Program determines the difficulty of the battle, language: C)
- File "Units.txt" serves as a file to store units on the battlefield, in which every unit has it's own set of modifiers, such as: Name,InitiativeFactor,Team,Hp,Ac,HitFactor,HitDamage
- Before battle starts each unit rolls the initiative to determine who goes in which order
- After that each unit starts to attack the enemy team unit (that means team PLAYER will attack unit of team MONSTER and vice versa)
- Each unit attacks the enemy unit with the highest initiative
- At the end program should determine the difficulty of the battle
  
Dungeon Manager (Website that stores data of the users, language: Python(mostly))
